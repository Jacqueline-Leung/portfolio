      <h2>What is HTML semantic elements?</h2>
      <p>What is HTML semantic elements? From w3school.com, it says “Semantic elements = elements with a meaning”. These elements self-explain clearly what they are, their tags express what kind of content they contain, which help clearly send the messages to both the browser and the developer, in turn facilitate the coding and understanding process. “div” and “span” can be examples of non-semantic elements, which tell us close to nothing; while “form” and “table” can be examples of semantic elements, which describe clearly what they are. According to the W3C: "A semantic Web allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprises, and communities." As the semantic elements clearly describe the meaning of the elements themselves, they simplify interpretation and lessen confusion, help other computers and programmers to understand the content and structure of a website, make internationalization and interoperability possible.</p>

      <h3><u>What is <b>Æbleskiver</b>?</u></h3>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Æbleskiver (Danish pronunciation: [ˈeːpləˌskiːwɐ], [singular: æbleskive]) are Danish snacks that are spherical in shape. The name literally means apple slices in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. The crust is similar in texture to European pancakes, but with a light and fluffy innard like a popover. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver or ebleskiver.(Wikipedia)</p>
